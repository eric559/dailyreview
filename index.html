                    <p>
My long term goal is by end of this school year I should have straight A or close to it. I will try to do all work and turn in all my assignments too complete this goal. I know there will be timers where I will be behind but I will try to catch up to where I am supposed to be at. Since I am trying to get all A I am also trying to get a scholarship for soccer which is what I am trying to go for.

                <h3>Short term goa ls</h3>
                    <p>My short term goal is by the time we get our report cards I should have my grades too b or higher. I want this short term goal because I will able to do more things when I am home. I do not have to worry about my grade dropping. Also I can go to soccer practice instead of getting yelled at about my grade.</p>
